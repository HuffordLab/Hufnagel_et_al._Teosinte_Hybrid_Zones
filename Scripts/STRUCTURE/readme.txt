In "Analysis", "sortStrucOutByAlt.py" takes a .indivq distruct input file, which is a piece of the STRUCTURE output, and sorts individuals by altitude.

In "Analysis", "makePopFile.py" consolidates hybrid information by population (sampling site) including averaging STRUCTURE q-values to create an R input file for plotting individual pies for each population.

In "Figure Generation", "makeAltPlots.R" plots altitude data for individuals labeled as parviglumis, mexicana, and maize.

In "Figure Generation", "plotAllDataOnMex.R" plots all individuals from the 967 SNP dataset on a map of Mexico.

In "Figure Generation", "plotHybridPies2.R" plots only Hybrid individuals as points on Mexico as well as STRUCTURE q-values as individual pie charts.
