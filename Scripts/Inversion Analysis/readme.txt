In "Analysis", "inv4mHapByAcc.py" calculates inv4m haplotypes and groups the data by accession alongside altitude and hybrid status.

In "Analysis", "inv4mSNPbyAcc.py" calculates PZD00030.1 genotype frequencies and groups the data by accession alongside altitude and hybrid status.


In "Figure Generation", "makeInv4mHapTable.R" makes a table of inv4m haplotypes across high confidence and ambiguous parviglumis and mexicana as well as the three hybrid groups.
