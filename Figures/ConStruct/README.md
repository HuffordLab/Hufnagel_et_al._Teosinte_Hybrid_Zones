"conStructPlots.png" is all conStruct results in a STRUCTURE-like bargraph format.
 
"constructTable.png" is a table of "other attribution" for various groups, where "other attribution" is the q-value attribution from conStruct to the teosinte subspecies not associated with individuals in each group.  For example if an individual is Zea mays ssp. parviglumis this number represents the conStruct q-value attribution to Zea mays ssp. mexicana.
