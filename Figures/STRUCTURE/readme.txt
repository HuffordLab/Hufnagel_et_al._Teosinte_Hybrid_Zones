"simpleStruc.pdf" is the original STRUCTURE results of the best k-value (3) of published 967 SNP data with altitudes used to define hybrids.

"allFangStrucWalt.pdf" is STRUCTURE results using all K values from the original STRUCTURE run of published 967 SNP data with altitude with altitudes and likelihood plots.

"bothStructWaltAll.pdf" is STRUCTURE results using all K values using both datasets with altitides and likelihood plots.

"bothStructWaltSome.pdf" is STRUCTURE results using a subset of K values using both datasets with altitides and likelihood plots.

"hybridsBig.png" and "HybridsSmall" are only hybrid individuals plotted on Mexico as black points.  These were plotted along with pie plots generated from STRUCTURE q-values and individuals plotted on mexico in order to create "HybridsOnMex.png".  Pie plots can be found in the folder "AllPies"

"dataOnMexico.pdf" is all individuals plotted on Mexico.

"HybridsOnMex.png" is the final figure containing all individuals plotted on Mexico, hybrids plotted on Mexico and hybrid q-values represented as pie charts.
